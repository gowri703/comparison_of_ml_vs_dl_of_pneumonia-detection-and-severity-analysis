# comparison_of_ml_vs_dl_of_pneumonia-detection-and-severity-analysis
A medical imaging project that benchmarks five supervised ML models against a DenseNet121 transfer learning model for pneumonia detection using chest X-rays. Includes preprocessing, augmentation, performance comparison, and visualization to show the accuracy gap between classical ML and deep learning approaches.
